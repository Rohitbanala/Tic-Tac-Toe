# Tic Tac Toe App

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built using React. The project focuses on learning core React concepts, including component-based architecture and lifting state up for effective state management. The app allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- Interactive 3x3 game board.
- Turn-based play with player symbols (e.g., `X` and `O`).
- Highlights the active player.
- Editable player names.
- Simple and responsive design.
- Clean separation of concerns using React components.

## Learning Objectives

### Key Concepts Explored:
1. **React Components:**
   - Breaking down the UI into reusable, manageable components like `GameBoard` and `PlayerInfo`.

2. **Lifting State Up:**
   - Managing the shared state (game board, active player, etc.) in a parent component and passing down data/functions via props to child components.

3. **State Management:**
   - Using React's `useState` hook for handling dynamic state updates.

4. **Event Handling:**
   - Handling user interactions such as button clicks and input changes to update the UI dynamically.
